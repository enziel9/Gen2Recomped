-- EMERALD'S POKe MART.
--
-- Reported from play: "the pokemart menu isn't gen3's pokemart menu for buy
-- or sell, it's falling back to gen1".  It was, in two separate ways, and the
-- words were only the first of them.
--
-- src/ui/ShopMenu.lua is pokered's DisplayPokemartDialogue_ -- a Game Boy list
-- in a 160x144 letterbox, asking game.data.text for `_Pokemart*` keys that no
-- Emerald dataset carries.  Those keys now resolve to the clerk's own script
-- (RomExtractorGen3:itemMenuActions writes constants.gen3MartText), which
-- fixed the sentences.  This fixes the screen: a 240x160 GBA counter with the
-- money in the corner, the stock down the right with its prices, and the
-- clerk talking in the panel underneath.
--
-- ONE SCREEN, TWO DIRECTIONS.  Buying and selling wear the same furniture on
-- the cartridge -- the same three panels, the same list, the same quantity
-- selector -- and differ only in what fills the list and what the clerk says.
-- So this is one screen with a `mode`, rather than two that have to be kept
-- looking alike.
--
-- WHAT IS DERIVED AND WHAT IS NOT.  Every word on it is the cartridge's, down
-- to the currency glyph -- the port had been printing Hoenn's prices with
-- Kanto's yen sign.  The PANEL GEOMETRY is not derived: it is measured off
-- the screen, and it deliberately matches src/ui/Gen3BagMenu.lua, because the
-- cartridge builds both out of the same furniture and a mart that does not
-- line up with the bag is wrong in a way a screenshot shows immediately.

-- so every counter in Hoenn fell straight through to src/ui/ShopMenu.lua,
-- pokered's Game Boy list, which is what those screenshots are.  This screen
-- had been built for exactly that complaint and only the decoration counters
-- were ever reaching it.
--
-- The three-row menu lives here rather than at the call site because it is
-- part of the counter: `pokemart` (mode 0) builds it at 0x00DFA8E and the two
-- decoration modes branch straight past it at 0x00DFA8C, which is why
-- Gen3Commands.g3_decoration_mart opens the list directly and this does not.
--
-- The words are the cartridge's -- gen3MartText carries BUY, SELL and QUIT --
-- and so is the LOOP: closing either list comes back here rather than
-- leaving the counter, which is the "Is there anything else I can help you
-- with?" the clerk says, and only QUIT (or B) hands the script back.
-- WHERE THE THREE-ROW BOX GOES, read rather than guessed.
--

-- window's INTERIOR -- the port's box includes its frame, so it is two tiles
-- wider and taller and starts one tile up and left.  extractShopMenu reads
-- it; a dataset without it keeps the Game Boy's corner.
--
-- The uiSize override matters as much as the coordinates: a menu with no
-- surface of its own is CENTRED inside the 240x160 the overworld holds, which
-- takes a box the cartridge puts two tiles from the left edge and drops it in
-- the middle of the screen.

-- and the pocket dots down its side.  So the flow moved into the bag and this
-- became the part that is the same either way -- ask how many, name a price,
-- take the yes.
