-- Emerald's TRAINER CARD.
--
-- Not the Gen 2 card.  That one is a Game Boy page with a badge row and a
-- Johto map; this is a 240x160 GBA card whose front carries the player's
-- name, their ID number, their money, their POKéDEX count and their play
-- time, with the eight badges along the bottom -- and a back with the link
-- record on it, which B flips to.
--
-- THE LABELS ARE THE CARTRIDGE'S, found the way the START menu's were: they
-- sit consecutively in the text region in the order the card prints them.
--
--   NAME:   IDNo.   MONEY   POKéDEX   TIME
--
-- and the title line, "{PLAYER}'s TRAINER CARD", is in the same block a few
-- strings later.  Reading them rather than writing them down is what keeps
-- the trailing space and the full stop in "IDNo." -- two details that are
-- wrong in every reconstruction and right here.
--
-- THE BADGES ARE THE CARTRIDGE'S NOW.  They were eight rectangles, filled
-- for the ones earned, because every search for the art had looked for a
-- SPRITE and the cartridge draws them as BACKGROUND TILES -- four tilemap
-- cells per badge, sixteen tiles across, eight side by side in one 1024-byte
-- sheet on one shared palette (RomExtractorGen3:trainerCardBadges).  Their
-- places on this card are the cartridge's too: the first sits four tiles in,
-- they step three tiles apart, and they sit on rows fifteen and sixteen.
--
-- AN UNEARNED BADGE IS NOT DRAWN AT ALL, which is what the cartridge does --
-- there is no empty socket waiting to be filled.
--
-- THE CARD ITSELF IS THE CARTRIDGE'S NOW, and the note that used to stand
-- here -- "the part to replace when that art is extracted" -- is what this
-- replaces.  Asked for directly, with a reference shot: the card is a printed
-- card, a titled pill with a ruled field, a Poke Ball watermark and a row of
-- eight badge sockets, and this port drew it in its own window frame.
--
-- The art is three screens (RomExtractorGen3:trainerCardArt): a FIELD that
-- tiles the backdrop, the FRONT over it, and a BACK that B flips to.  Finding
-- them started from the one place in the card's code that copies 416 bytes of
-- palette, which named the palette; the compressed blocks the same code names
-- gave four screen-sized tilemaps, and their own shapes told them apart -- the
-- field uses a single tile, the front and the link-front are identical except
-- across the badge rows, and the remainder is the back.
--
-- WHERE THE TEXT GOES IS MEASURED OFF THAT ART, not guessed.  The front draws
-- a small marker box at the left of every field row and a rule under the name,
-- so the rows are where the cartridge's own markers are: y=44, 68, 84 and 100,
-- with the name's rule at 57.  There are four markers and five fields because
-- the ID number is not one of the rows -- it sits in the header band to the
-- right of the pill, which is clear from x=116 to x=230.  The badge sockets
-- measure 16 wide from x=32 at a pitch of 24 on row 15, which is exactly where
-- this file was already putting them: the two derivations agree.
--
-- AND THE PORTRAIT IS ON IT AFTER ALL.  The note that stood here said there
-- was none -- the front's right-hand corner carries a Poke Ball watermark and
-- nothing else, so the picture was drawn only on the fallback frame, and the
-- card the player actually sees had no trainer on it.  Reported from play:
-- "the trainer sprite is also missing from the trainer card".
--
-- The watermark is a WATERMARK: the cartridge blits the 64x64 front pic over
-- it.  Not a sprite -- CreateTrainerCardTrainerPicSprite blits into a window,
-- and the card's WIN_TRAINER_PIC sits at tile (19, 5) with the Hoenn layout
-- adding (1, 0) pixels, so the picture lands at (153, 40) and runs to
-- (217, 104).  Measuring the watermark in the extracted front art gives very
-- nearly that box: the two derivations agree, which is the identification.
