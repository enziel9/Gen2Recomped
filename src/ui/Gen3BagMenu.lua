-- Emerald's BAG.
--
-- Not the Gen 2 pack with different words.  That screen is a Game Boy list in
-- a 160x144 letterbox with four pockets called ITEMS / BALLS / KEY ITEMS /
-- TM-HM; this one is a 240x160 GBA screen with FIVE, in the cartridge's own
-- order, its own words, and a description panel under the list that the Game
-- Boy bag does not have.
--
-- WHERE THE POCKETS COME FROM, and why it matters that they are read.
--
-- Nothing on the cartridge declares the bag's contents either -- but the five
-- pocket names sit CONSECUTIVELY in the text region in tab order, so that run
-- is the layout, exactly as the START menu's labels were.
--
--   ITEMS   POKé BALLS   TMs & HMs   BERRIES   KEY ITEMS
--
-- And there is a trap in it: the SAME five words appear a second time, in a
-- DIFFERENT order, as the PC's deposit list (ITEMS, KEY ITEMS, POKé BALLS,
-- TMs & HMs, BERRIES).  Nothing but the order tells the two runs apart, so
-- the discovery pass locates both and records them separately; this screen
-- reads the BAG's.  Written from memory it would have had KEY ITEMS third.
--
-- THE BAG ITSELF is the cartridge's too, now.  It never passes a background
-- loader -- it is a compressed SPRITE sheet -- so every graphics pass here
-- was structurally blind to it, and the screen had a rectangle of empty green
-- where the biggest object on it belongs.  The discovery pass finds it as a
-- same-tag PAIR of sheets (the boy's bag and the girl's), six 64x64 frames
-- each, with the sprite palette carrying that tag right behind them.
--
-- WHICH FRAME goes with which pocket is a reconstruction: the six are the bag
-- tilted toward each tab, and pairing them in order is the reading that makes
-- the tilt follow the cursor.  What is NOT reconstructed is the art or which
-- of the two bags a save carries -- that is the player's own answer to
-- Birch's question.
--
-- THE GEOMETRY IS DERIVED NOW TOO, and it was the last thing here that was
-- not.  sDefaultBagWindows is six { bg, tileX, tileY, w, h, palette,
-- baseBlock } rows terminated by a $FF, and the ten unterminated rows behind
-- it are the context menu's; the list's own offsets -- where the item name
-- starts, where the cursor goes, where the count is right-aligned -- come off
-- its ListMenuTemplate.  All of it was already in the cache under
-- gen3BagScreen and this screen read NONE of it: three boxes placed by hand
-- on a flat green fill, with the cartridge's own 240x160 field sitting
-- unused beside them.
--
-- The item's picture is derived as well: gItemIconTable is 378 pairs of an
-- LZ77 24x24 sheet and an LZ77 palette, composed into one atlas whose slot is
-- the item's own cartridge index.
