--
--     [info] version switch: dropped 75 cached image(s) ...
--     [info] player sheet: SPRITE_G3_000 -> assets/generated/overworld/...
--
-- -- the second line appearing on the FIRST boot and NOT on the second.  The
-- image flush was working; the Player never asked it for anything, because
-- setMap builds one only `if self.player` is nil and Emerald's was still
-- there, holding a SpriteRenderer that had captured Emerald's Image before
-- the flush.  Player:refreshForm could not save it either: it rebuilds when
-- the sprite ID changes, and the player is object-event graphics 0 in BOTH
-- cartridges, so the id is SPRITE_G3_000 either way and the guard sees no
-- change at all.
--
-- A list rather than a wipe, because this table also carries the class's own
-- fields -- STILL_REFLECTIONS, BERRY_TREE_HOLD, isOpaque and the test exports
-- -- and clearing those would break it in a way no boot recovers from.  What
-- is listed is everything on this state that is built FROM Game.data and kept
-- across maps: the player, and each sheet cached on first use behind an `if
-- not self.<name>` guard.  Anything added to that pattern later belongs here.

-- Neighbor maps drawn at the composed connection offsets: at least the

-- widened to everything the current view size can show so a full
-- zoom-out never runs past the rendered set.  Re-run whenever the view
-- grows (zoom/resize), not only on setMap.
--
-- Neighbors are built eagerly here.  A TileRenderer is now a light object --
-- the tile layer draws windowed to the camera, so nothing per-map is
-- constructed up front (see TileRenderer) -- so there is no build cost to
-- amortize and no prefetch race to lose at a seam.  That is what the old
-- one-per-frame streaming queue existed to hide, and it is gone.
-- How far out from the player the neighbour set has to reach, in world
-- pixels, as a HALF-EXTENT either side.
--
-- The flat view answers this for itself: half the visible world plus a tile
-- row of slack is exactly what a 160x144 screen can show past its own edge.
-- A 3D renderer cannot use that answer. A diorama camera pulled back over a
-- route sees several screens in every direction, and what is not in
-- `self.neighbors` is not merely undrawn -- it was never loaded, so the
-- renderer has no map there to mesh and falls back to its own border-block
-- apron. That is the wall of border tiles fencing in a route, and the
-- neighbour that only appears once you have crossed the seam: the set is
-- rebuilt around the new map on arrival, which is the first moment it
-- contains anything you were already looking at.
--
-- So a renderer that sees further says so, by setting `neighborReachW` /
-- `neighborReachH` on the world -- the same shape as `viewW`/`viewH`, and
-- for the same reason: the engine cannot infer another renderer's frustum,
-- and guessing a generous default would load half of Johto for the flat game
-- that never asked. Unset is today's behaviour exactly.
--
-- Widening this is not free -- every neighbour is a loaded Map and a spawned
-- ghost cast -- which is why it is a request from the thing doing the drawing
-- rather than a constant here.

-- Queue a script for a map's onEnter hook to run once it is safe to.  A

-- warp command's runner is still suspended-alive; starting a runner there
-- would trip ScriptRunner:run's assert(not isRunning()).  So onEnter stashes
-- the script here and update() drains the FIFO head once the world is
-- idle, one script per idle frame.
-- WHEN THE PLAYER IS SOMEWHERE ELSE, WHICH IS NOT THE SAME AS "TOOK A STEP".
--
-- Reported from play: "areas that push me back like the little girl blocking
-- the route, or birches event or the sandstorm when i dont ahve the glasses
-- can be bypassed if it moves me back and i walk back into it enough".  They
-- could, and every one of those is the same shape: a coord event fires, its
-- script walks the player back off the cell, and the player walks straight in
-- again -- through it this time.
--
-- The coord side remembers which of its rows have fired AT THE CELL THE
-- PLAYER IS ON, so a row cannot run twice for one visit.  It learned about
-- moves from onStep, and onStep is deliberately not called for a SCRIPTED
-- step -- or a cutscene would set off every trigger it walks the player
-- across.  So the walk-BACK was invisible to it: the memory still said "you
-- are on that cell and the row has fired", and the second attempt walked
-- through the fence.
--
-- A counter bumped whenever the player's cell changes, however it changed,
-- is what the memory needs instead of a pair of coordinates.  Warps, ledge
-- hops, scripted walks and ordinary steps all move the player and all bump
-- it; standing still does not.
-- WHO IS ACTUALLY ON THIS MAP, AND WHERE, once per entry.
--
-- A Gen 3 map decides its cast twice and both halves are silent.  The object
-- event's own flag says whether it spawns at all; the map's ON_TRANSITION
-- script then walks the ones that did to wherever the story wants them, with
-- `setobjectxyperm`.  When somebody is missing those two failures look
-- identical from inside the game -- "Steven is not outside the gym" is the
-- same picture whether his hide flag is set or the script that moves him
-- there never ran -- and telling them apart otherwise means asking the player
-- to save so the flags can be read off the file, which is exactly what
-- somebody mid-way through testing a cutscene cannot do.
--
-- IT HAS TO WAIT FOR THE SCRIPT.  A map's ON_TRANSITION does not run inside
-- setMap: it is queued (see queueScript) and drained by update() once the
-- world is idle, which is a frame or more later.  Reported from setMap the
-- line said "moved: none" for every map in the game -- true at the moment it
-- was asked and useless, because the moving had not happened yet.

-- gym after he catches ralts".  The Wally tutorial's script walks the player
-- home and hands over to the gym's own scene, and somewhere in that handover
-- the runner parks and never wakes: the map draws, the music plays, and no
-- button does anything for the rest of the session.  `runner:isRunning()`
-- gates every input frame in this file, so a coroutine yielded with nothing
-- left to wake it is a total loss with no message.
--
-- The cartridge cannot reach this state -- its script context is torn down by
-- the map change -- so a port that can must at least be able to SAY so.  What
-- counts as progress is everything that legitimately parks a script:
--
--   * a frame wait counting down, or a per-frame poll being asked
--   * a scripted walk in flight, or the player mid-step
--   * a movement wait that is still watching for its walker
--   * anything on top of the field -- a text box, a battle, a menu, a
--     transition -- because the field does not update underneath those, so
--     this function is not even called
--
-- With none of those true for SIX SECONDS the script is not waiting for
-- anything: it is stranded.  That is said out loud, once, with the map on it;
-- and after a further six the runner is put down so the player has their game
-- back.  Recovering is not a fix and is not meant to look like one -- the log
-- line is the fix's starting point -- but a stranded cutscene should cost a
-- scene, not a save.

-- own event flag before the fade (`setevent EVENT_TEAM_ROCKET_BASE_B2F_LANCE`),
-- which the ROM deliberately lets a LIVE object ignore -- and then the very
-- next `disappear` of an unrelated grunt re-ran this filter, saw Lance's flag
-- set, and deleted him.  The matching `clearevent` a few rows later does not
-- re-spawn anything (setevent/clearevent never do, by design), so Lance was
-- simply absent for the whole post-battle scene: every turnobject and
-- applymovement aimed at him did nothing, and he turned up on the next map
-- load wherever the respawn tables happened to put him.  The full sweep is
-- still correct for what it models -- LoadMapObjects, driven by
-- refreshmap/reloadmap -- so it stays available with `only` unset.

-- both of the voxel mods hold directly.
--
-- Lose an NPC from `entities` alone and it does not error, it does not warn,
-- and it does not go away: it stands there invisible, still solid, still
-- talking when you press A into it. That is the Elite Four report -- beat
-- Will, he stops being drawn, and you can still walk up to nothing and get
-- his post-battle line.
--
-- So the invariant gets asserted in one place instead of maintained in seven.

-- wild Pokemon are entities nothing here owns), and rebuilding must not
-- quietly delete somebody else's actor to fix ours.

  -- ON_WARP_INTO_MAP runs once as the map is entered, ON_FRAME_TABLE is
  -- re-asked on the field's frame until a row matches.  Running the frame
  -- table only on entry, through the deferred queue, put its var write one
  -- frame behind the arrival step -- and on Route 101 the arrival step IS
  -- the trigger, so Birch never got chased.
  --
  -- ...BUT NOT BEFORE THE MAP'S OWN ENTRY SCRIPT HAS RUN.  A map's
  -- ON_TRANSITION is QUEUED by setMap and the queue deliberately will not
  -- drain while `transitioning` is true, so during a warp fade the entry
  -- script has not run yet -- and this hook was gated on nothing but the
  -- runner, so the frame table was asked with the map's vars still holding
  -- whatever the last map left in them.
  --
  -- Sootopolis Gym is the case, and it is a bad one.  Its ON_TRANSITION is
  -- `setvar $4022, 1` and its frame table's last row is `$4022 == 0 ->
  -- lockall / applymovement / playse / warphole 15 1` -- the cutscene where
  -- the ice gives way and you drop to the floor below.  The setvar exists for
  -- exactly one reason: so that row cannot match on arrival.  Asked during the
  -- fade it matched every time, and walking through the gym door dropped the
  -- player straight through the floor without touching the ice.

  -- script is about to overwrite; the cartridge cannot reach either, because

    -- the re-ask, and the player stands on a live trigger that has never been
    -- put to it.  Step off and back on and it fires, which is what was seen.

    -- table's own script has run and written its var, and on the player being
    -- still so a mid-step cell is never the one asked about; the serial is
    -- only consumed once the ask really happens, so a frame spent running the
    -- frame table just defers it rather than eating it.

--     these cells: a mat is a warp tile and is not a door tile.  Checked
--     against the real data -- MAP_G01_N00's (8,8) and (9,8) both answer
--     false -- so canCollisionWarp is false on every mat in the game.

-- the rom".
--
-- The drawing was never the problem -- drawGen3Gates has always handed

-- which is the cartridge's own trick: it ships one drawing and turns it with
-- an affine animation rather than carrying four sprites.  What jumped was the
-- NUMBER.  The orientation is one of four values kept in a save var, so the
-- instant the push lands the angle is already ninety degrees further on and
-- there is nothing in between.
--
-- So the var goes on being the truth and a SWING is remembered beside it:
-- where the gate came from, how far it is going, and how much of that is
-- done.  The var is still written at once -- collision, the puzzle's state
-- and a save taken mid-swing all see the finished orientation exactly as
-- before -- and only the picture lags behind it.
--
-- SIGNED, because an orientation cannot say which way round it went: 3 -> 0
-- is a quarter turn clockwise, and reads as three quarters the other way once
-- it has been wrapped.  Gen3Gates.step hands over the step it applied.
--
-- ONE STEP LONG, AND THE STEP THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.  The gate turns
-- while the player walks through it -- the cartridge's own collision answer
-- to a push is "no collision", so the push and the step are one move -- and a
-- swing outlasting the step would leave the player standing beyond a gate
-- still visibly closing behind them.
--
-- Taken off the PLAYER rather than from a constant, because the step is not
-- one length: `stepFrames` is a field default a dataset may set, and the bike
-- has its own and is half as fast.  Push a gate on the Mach Bike and the

--
--   * both gate OAM templates (0x0591D48 / 0x0591D50) ask for OBJ priority
--     2, which is the same band an ordinary ground-level object event is in
--     (sElevationToPriority, 0x050E634, elevation 3 -> 2), so the tie is
--     broken by SUBPRIORITY and by nothing else;
--   * RotatingGate_CreateGatesWithinViewport (0FB9FC) hands
--     CreateSpriteAtEnd a subpriority of `mov r3,#148` -- a CONSTANT, the
--     same for every gate on the map -- while an object event's is
--     (16 - its screen row) * 2 + sElevationToSubpriority (0x050E644, at most
--     2) + the base it was made with, which cannot reach past about 34.
--
-- Lower subpriority draws in front, so 148 is behind every person in the
-- room from every square of it: the gate never covers anybody.  Drawn here
-- instead -- after the ground, before the entity pass -- and the top layer
-- still covers it, which priority 2 also says.
--
-- The FIRST half of that report is not a bug: CheckForRotatingGatePuzzleCollision
-- (0FBEF0) returns NO COLLISION after a gate turns (0119A4E's sibling at
-- 0FBFA8 branches into the rotate and falls out through the zero return), so
-- you push the gate round and walk on in the same step.  It only looked wrong

-- `crack.hole`, not `crack.floor`, so armCrackedFloor declines) and ticks
-- nothing (no slot holds that cell any more).  You could stroll across an
-- open hole all day.
--
-- Which floors "work fine" falls straight out of that: the ones where the

-- which is the whole reason the engine writes a metatile whose behaviour no

-- the countdown uses, so the floor below and the slip animation stay the
-- script's exactly as before.

--

-- and it is why a mud ramp is a RUN on the mach bike and impossible on the
-- acro one.

-- since the ladder was wired to the step -- but it never slowed down again.

-- the ride: stand still, walk to the mud ramp, climb it from a standstill.
-- That is not a ramp you have to run at, which is the whole of what the Mach
-- Bike is for.
--
-- THE CARTRIDGE'S OWN THREE ARMS (sMachBikeTransitions, 059744C):
--
--   TRY_SPEED_UP    a direction held: move, and raise the counter while it is
--                   below two (0119316) -- the climb this already had
--   TRY_SLOW_DOWN   the d-pad released with speed still on the clock: `if

--                   (0119344) -- ONE RUNG PER FRAME, a coast rather than a stop
--   FACE_DIRECTION  standing, and it calls Bike_ResetCounters (011A128), which
--                   zeroes the counter and the speed together
--
-- and the collision arm of TRY_SPEED_UP calls Bike_ResetCounters too, so
-- riding into a wall costs the run as well.
--
-- The test is the HELD DIRECTION and not `moving`: a step ends one frame
-- before the next begins, so a rule written on movement would empty the
-- counter between every pair of steps and the ladder could never leave its
-- first rung.

-- deep water like it.  You'll drop to the seafloor.  When you want to come
-- back up, use DIVE again.  In some places, it won't be possible for you to
-- surface, though."
--
-- Three of those clauses are data, and all three come out of the import:
--
--   * the dark patches are one metatile behaviour (constants.gen3Dive.behaviour);
--   * the seafloor under a route is a whole separate map, named by the route
--     header's own connection list -- direction 5 down, 6 back up -- and the
--     same size to the cell, which is why the warp keeps (x, y) exactly;
--   * the places you cannot surface are two more behaviours, on the seafloor
--     side (constants.gen3Dive.noSurfacing).
--
-- Underwater the player is NOT surfing: the seafloor is elevation 3, the
-- same as dry land, and setMap takes the arrival cell's elevation -- so the
-- walk down there needs nothing special from Collision at all.

      -- collisionCells at all, so it returns nil for every cell in Sinnoh and
      -- the branch falls to `return false`.  And if it did answer, the list it
      -- would check is Gen4Behaviors.group("door") = { 0x69 DOOR } -- while of
      -- the 1,213 warps in the cartridge, joined destMap/destWarp to the

      -- 0x69 is the door tile in the wall, which the player never stands on.

-- colour like it's supposed to".  Both were this.
--
-- A Gen 3 renderer bakes the visible window into a sprite batch and only
-- rebuilds it when something says so -- which is why the cartridge's own
-- scripts change a metatile with `setmetatile` and then call
-- DrawWholeMapView.  Every terrain effect in Hoenn wrote its new block
-- straight into the map and never asked for the redraw: the ice cracked, the
-- ash swept, the log sank and the plank sagged, all of it recorded and none
-- of it drawn until something else happened to rebuild the window (usually
-- leaving the room).  A puzzle you cannot see the state of is a puzzle you
-- cannot solve.
--
-- Takes the map because two of the callers are putting a cell back on a map
-- the player has already walked off.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- HOENN'S TALL GRASS IS A SPRITE, NOT A LAYER.
--
-- Reported from play: "grass isnt hiding my playing sprite behind it".  On a
-- Game Boy map the trick is a BG overdraw -- drawCellBottom redraws the
-- cell's lower tile row over the character's feet -- and on Gen 3 that call
-- is a silent no-op, because a Gen 3 renderer has no 8x8 tile atlas to draw
-- it out of.  Every Gen 3 metatile's SECOND layer is already drawn above the
-- sprites, which is what puts a character behind a treetop, so the obvious
-- guess is that the grass belongs there -- and it does not: metatile 13, the
-- ordinary tall grass every route in Hoenn is made of, is 256 opaque pixels
-- on the bottom layer and ZERO on the top.  There is nothing there to hide
-- behind.
--
-- Emerald draws the blades as a FIELD EFFECT: a sixteen-square sprite spawned
-- on the cell, drawn over whoever is standing in it, and taken away when they
-- leave.  The art and its palette are read off the cartridge's field-effect
-- template table (constants.gen3TallGrass); the five frames are the rustle,
-- and the last of them is the resting tuft that covers a standing player's

-- A MOVE WHOSE WALKER IS GONE MUST STILL END.
--
-- `#self.scriptMoves > 0` is one of the conditions that says "a script owns
-- the map": it gates every input frame AND drainPendingScripts.  So a single
-- queued move that can never retire does not slow anything down -- it locks
-- the player where they stand, with no text box, no cutscene and nothing on
-- screen to say why.  That is the worst failure shape this file has.
--
-- Two ways a move gets stranded, and the loop below could retire neither:
--
--   * the entity is nil.  The retirement test reads `not (mv.entity and
--     mv.entity.moving)`, which is TRUE for a nil entity -- but it is paired
--     with `mv.remaining <= 0`, and a fresh move has steps left.  The starting
--     loop then skips it too (both its arms begin `if e and ...`).  Never
--     retired, never stepped.
--
--   * the entity was DESPAWNED mid-step.  syncEventFlagObjects removes an
--     object from `npcs` and `entities` the moment a script hides it, and a
--     cutscene routinely hides someone who is walking.  Nothing then updates
--     that sprite, so `moving` stays true for ever and the first test never
--     passes.
--
-- The cartridge has no equivalent: a despawned object's movement simply stops
-- being anyone's business.  So an orphaned move is retired HERE and its
-- onDone still fires -- which is what lets the chain behind it finish, the
-- `waitmovement` that was waiting on it resume, and the queue drain.

-- THE TILESET ATLAS A MAP DRAWS FROM, for a mod that renders the world itself.
--
-- A 3D world pipeline cannot use the finished 2D map canvas: voxel geometry
-- samples the tileset SHEET per face, with its own UVs. So a mod that replaces
-- the world pass needs the same sheet the flat renderer builds its quads from,
-- and the tileset record that says how it is laid out.
--
-- The name is the one Gen1Recomp published and mods were written against
-- (`World:atlasFor`). Without it STADIUM2_OVERWORLD_MODELS fails at
-- `attachRenderer` with "Gold World:atlasFor is unavailable", its renderFrame
-- returns no canvas, and the engine quietly falls back to the flat draw --
-- which reads, from the player's side, as "the 3D world just does not turn on"
-- with an empty log and every option switched on. Providing it is cheap and it
-- is the seam the contract already assumed.
--
-- Returns the RAW sheet, deliberately, plus the tileset record:
--   * a caller doing its own colour work (Gen 2 art is four-shade source, and
--     the palette is chosen per 8x8 tile at bake time) needs the unbaked
--     pixels, and re-baking an already-baked atlas would double-apply it;
--   * `map.renderer.image` -- the baked one -- stays available to anything
--     that wants what the 2D path actually painted.
--
-- `mapDef` is a map DEFINITION (`Game.data.maps.CERULEAN_CITY`), matched
-- against the current map and its loaded neighbours first so the live tileset
-- record (with any runtime normalisation on it) wins; a def for a map that is
-- not resident falls back to the static tileset table.
-- Returns nil when the sheet cannot be resolved -- never raises, because this
-- runs inside a mod's render callback.

--
-- Everything a 3D pipeline needs to build Hoenn as geometry, in one table, and

-- renderer three things Gen 1 and Gen 2 never had, and all three are the
-- difference between a diorama that guesses and one that knows:
--
--   * a BEHAVIOUR byte per metatile.  Gen 2 stores a collision class and the
--     art has to be read to find out what a cell IS; Gen 3 says outright that
--     this cell is tall grass, deep water, a jumpable ledge facing south, a
--     door, a counter, a bookshelf, ice, a log raft.
--   * a LAYER TYPE per metatile, which is the cartridge's own answer to "does
--     the player pass in front of this or behind it".  A voxel renderer spends
--     most of its guessing budget on exactly that question.
--   * an ELEVATION per CELL.  Gen 2 records no height at all -- a terrace and
--     the grass below it are both collision $00, which is why the Johto
--     profile has to infer terraces from floor art.  Gen 3 gives the Y axis
--     directly, and it is what makes Route 110's cycling road stand over the
--     sea rather than lie in it.
--
-- Returns nil on Gen 1 and Gen 2, which is how a caller tests for the arm.
-- Never raises: this runs inside a mod's render callback.

-- WHAT IS GROWING IN THE PLOT, DRAWN.
--
-- Reported from play: "berry trees are invisible same with sprouts etc".
-- Three things were missing at once and the cartridge does all three in one
-- function, SetBerryTreeGraphics:
--
--   * THE FRAME IS THE STAGE.  StartSpriteAnim(sprite, berryStage) -- the
--     tree's animation table IS its five growth stages, and the import reads
--     which frames each one cycles (gen3Berries.trees.stages) rather than
--     counting them out.  Without it every tree showed frame zero, which is
--     the seed: a fruiting tree drew a bare patch of soil.
--   * THE SHEET IS THE BERRY.  `sprite->images` is swapped to the berry's own
--     pic table, so a PECHA tree and an ORAN tree are different art from the
--     flowering stage on.
--   * AND AN EMPTY PLOT IS INVISIBLE, which this port already did (see
--     plotEmpty in the draw pass) and is the only one of the three that was
--     right.
--
-- Asked every frame rather than at spawn, for the same reason plotEmpty is:
-- a tree is planted, grows, is watered and is picked without the map ever
-- reloading.  It costs a table lookup per tree, and a map has at most three.
-- WHICH GROUND SHOWS YOU BACK.
--
-- Reported from play: "puddles and the bright blue water arent showing their
-- reflections like they do in the emerald rom".  The set is not named here --
-- it is derived at import from MetatileBehavior_IsReflective (see
-- extractReflections) and comes out as POND_WATER, PUDDLE and Sootopolis'
-- lake.  Notably NOT ocean or deep water: those are surfable, and what
-- reflects there is the surfer, standing on the blob, on one of these.
--
-- A cache that predates the stage answers nothing and nothing reflects, which
-- is exactly what this port did before and is a missing picture rather than a
-- wrong one.
-- ASKED ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES A FRAME, so the behaviour list is turned into a
-- lookup once rather than walked for every cell of every reflection search.
-- The set is data that only changes with the dataset, and `reflectSet` is the
-- table it was built from, so a reloaded cache rebuilds it.
function OverworldState:reflectiveBehaviours()
  local set = Game and Game.data and Game.data.constants
              and Game.data.constants.gen3Reflection
  local list = set and set.behaviours
  if not list then return nil end

-- ...AND THE WATER IS RARELY THE TILE YOU ARE STANDING ON.
--
-- Reported from play, after the first cut of this shipped: "its working only
-- when surfing, its supposed to work for puddles and when standing on ground
-- near water as well".  That is right, and the first cut asked the wrong
-- question -- it asked what is under the FEET, which is only ever true while
-- you are surfing or standing in a puddle.
--
-- What a top-down reflection actually needs is the water the character is
-- standing ABOVE: the cells BELOW them, which is where their image would
-- fall.  So the search starts one row down and runs as many rows as the
-- sprite is tall in cells, spreading out to its width -- the first reflective
-- cell wins, and the object's own cell is asked first so a puddle underfoot
-- still reflects.
--
-- WHAT IS DERIVED HERE AND WHAT IS NOT, said plainly because the two are
-- different: the SET of reflective behaviours is read off the cartridge
-- (extractReflections finds MetatileBehavior_IsReflective by shape and picks
-- it out of two candidates by which one a ground effect calls).  The SHAPE of
-- this search -- one row down, the sprite's own size -- is not: the
-- cartridge's ground-effect flag reads a single behaviour byte off the object
-- struct, and the wider scan that Emerald plainly does could not be located
-- in the code.  It is sized off the sprite rather than a number chosen here,
-- and it is short on purpose: a character in the middle of a field does not
-- reflect, one at the water's edge does.
--
-- ...AND IT RETURNS THE CELLS, NOT A YES.
--
-- The first cut answered "does this character reflect" with a boolean, and
-- that turned out to be half an answer: reported twice from play, "the npc
-- relections need to be masked by the ground and bridges, walkable areas
-- etc".  A reflection is visible exactly where there is water to hold it and
-- NOWHERE ELSE -- so the same cells that decide whether it reflects at all
-- are the clip region it has to be drawn through, and finding them twice
-- (once to decide, once to mask) is how the two drift apart.
--
-- The list is the cells the reflection can actually be PAINTED in, which is
-- the column the sprite stands in and the rows its mirrored image falls
-- across -- its own cell (a puddle underfoot) down through as many rows as
-- it is tall.  Water to one SIDE is not in that list on purpose: the image
-- falls straight down in this projection, so a character beside a pond
-- reflects into whatever is directly below them, not into the pond.
--
-- ...AND THE SHAPE IS THE CARTRIDGE'S, not a guess any more.
--
-- ObjectEventCheckForReflectiveSurface (ROM:0096A8C) is exactly this loop,
-- and it settles three things the first two cuts got wrong:
--
--   * it NEVER asks about the object's own cell.  It starts one row DOWN
--     (`mov r0,#1 / mov r10,r0`, then `y + r10 + i`) and runs `height` rows
--     from there, so a character reflects into the water they are standing
--     ABOVE and a puddle underfoot does not reflect them at all.
--   * the extent is the sprite's own size in cells, `(w + 8) / 16` and
--     `(h + 8) / 16` -- so an ordinary 16x32 character is ONE column and TWO
--     rows, and the sideways sweep the previous cut did is not in the
--     cartridge for that size at all.
--   * it asks the same of previousCoords (`ldsh [r5,#0x14]`/`[r5,#0x16]`)
--     as of currentCoords, which is what keeps a reflection alive across the
--     sixteen frames of a step instead of blinking at every cell boundary.
--     Here the pair is (cellX, targetX): mid-step this port leaves cellX on
--     the cell being left and targetX on the one being entered.
--
-- The returned cells are also the clip region (see the draw pass), so a
-- character beside water rather than above it reflects into nothing, which
-- is the same picture the cartridge draws for the same reason.

-- ---- RINGS WHERE A FOOT MEETS WATER ---------------------------------------

-- behaviours, and the set is read off MetatileBehavior_HasRipples at import
-- rather than named here (see RomExtractorGen3.RIPPLE) -- it comes out as
-- pond water, a puddle and the shallow water you can walk through.
--
-- The ring is an object at priority 3 with subpriority 151, against a
-- reflection's 152: both sit under everything of the map except its bottom
-- layer, and the rings sit over the reflection.  So this draws in the same
-- pass, after the reflections, and is covered by the same layers.
--
-- WHY "when the step finishes" is a cell change and not a movement callback:
-- the cartridge asks its ground-effect question once a step has completed and
-- the object's currentCoords have moved on.  Watching the cell an entity is
-- ON is the same event, arrives for the player and every NPC alike, and needs
-- no hook in either mover.

-- DOES THIS WATER HOLD THE IMAGE STILL, OR SWAY IT?
--
-- Two answers, and only one of them is the cartridge's.
--
--   ICE is the cartridge's.  SetUpReflection takes a `stillReflection`
--   argument and the ice ground effect passes TRUE, which is what turns the
--   affine matrix off and leaves a plain mirrored sprite -- ice does not
--   move, so its reflection does not either.  MetatileBehavior_IsIce
--   (ROM:0088ED4) tests exactly one behaviour, $20.
--
--   A PUDDLE is not.  The cartridge treats it like any other reflective
--   ground, but a puddle is a few inches of water in a footprint and reading
--   a swaying reflection into one looks wrong, so it is held still here by
--   choice: "make the puddles perfect reflections no distortion but the
--   lakes/ponds be the distorted ones".
--
-- Both are asked by NAME rather than by number -- gen3Reflection.named comes
-- off the cartridge's own behaviour table -- so a ROM that numbers them
-- differently still lands right.

    -- WHO THE TOP LAYER COVERS, which is not everybody.
    --
    -- Reported from play: "when walking on bridges it makes my character go
    -- under them rather than walking on top of them".  On the cartridge the
    -- covering layer is a background at priority 1 and the sprite's own
    -- priority comes from its elevation, so an object on ordinary ground
    -- (priority 2) is hidden by it and one on a bridge deck (priority 1) is
    -- not -- see extractSpritePriority.  Here that is the same thing as
    -- drawing the deck's walkers AFTER the layer instead of before it.
    -- ---- REFLECTIONS FIRST, AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOP LAYER ------
    --
    -- Reported from play: "the twins are reflected onto the deck instead of
    -- below it" and "they need to be obfuscated by the ground".  Both are the
    -- same thing.  A character standing on a bridge is deliberately drawn
    -- AFTER the top layer (see `onTop` below) so the deck does not bury them
    -- -- and their reflection has to be on the OPPOSITE side of that layer,
    -- because what the deck hides is exactly what makes it read as a
    -- reflection in the water under the bridge rather than a second person
    -- standing on the planks.
    --
    -- So it is its own pass, before every sprite and before drawAbove, for
    -- every entity including the ones that will be drawn on top.  Whether a
    -- given entity reflects at all is still decided here, at draw time, since
    -- a character walks between water's edge and dry ground without the map
    -- reloading.
    --
    -- ...AND CLIPPED TO THE WATER ITSELF.  Reported twice: "they need to be
    -- masked by the ground and bridges, walkable areas etc".  Drawing the
    -- reflection before the top layer is not enough, because most of what has
    -- to cover it -- a bridge deck, a bank, a path -- is in the BOTTOM layer
    -- and was already on screen before the sprite pass began.
    --
    -- So the pass is CLIPPED to the reflective cells.  That is the rule the
    -- cartridge's own priorities produce and it needs no per-tile redrawing:
    -- a reflection is visible exactly where there is water to hold it, and
    -- nowhere else.
    --
    -- WITH THE SCISSOR, NOT THE STENCIL, and that is the whole of why the
    -- first cut of this masking shipped and did nothing.  It called
    -- love.graphics.stencil inside a pcall -- but this engine draws the world
    -- into a canvas built by src/render/PixelCanvas.lua, which asks for no
    -- depth/stencil buffer, so the stencil call THREW on every frame, the
    -- pcall swallowed it, and the fallback drew the reflections unmasked.
    -- The symptom was a masking pass that appeared to be installed and had
    -- never once run.
    --
    -- The scissor has no such requirement and costs nothing here, because
    -- what has to be clipped is a set of axis-aligned 16x16 cells -- a
    -- rectangle each, which is precisely what a scissor is.  It is set per
    -- cell and intersected with whatever clip the caller already had, so a
